Instructions

As part of your job, you’ve been asked to build a website that displays information about various minerals (AKA rocks). The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. 
Clicking on a mineral’s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.

A web designer has already designed the pages. You only need to write the code to created the pages as they’ve been designed. Use the included HTML/CSS files to see how to structure and style the pages. You don’t need to alter global.css - just use it as is.

8 steps
-To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

WARNING: If you are attempting this project on a Windows operating system, you will need to unpack the provided project .zip file using a third-party unzip utility such as one of the following:

7-Zip (free, open source)
WinZip (free evaluation)
WinRAR (free evaluation)
Using the Windows Explorer default unzip utility may cause your mineral image filenames to be decoded with the wrong character set causing a mismatch between the names in the minerals.json file and your filenames of your images.

-Use SQLite to store the mineral data.
Open minerals.json and look at the attributes of a mineral. Write a model to store the mineral data. Each mineral can have the following attributes. Some minerals will not have all of these attributes.

name
image filename
image caption
category
formula
strunz classification
color
crystal system
unit cell
crystal symmetry
cleavage
mohs scale hardness
luster
streak
diaphaneity
optical properties
refractive index
crystal habit
specific gravity

Write a script to that constructs a mineral model instance for each mineral in minerals.json and saves them to a SQLite database.

-Create a layout template for the app.
The layout template should contain the title of the site. You can name the site anything you want.

-Create a template and view to show the names of all the minerals.
This view should display the name of each mineral in the database. Each name in the list is a link to the detail view of the mineral. See index.html and list-preview.png

-Create a mineral details template and view.
The detail view should display the details of the selected mineral.

-The details template should contain the mineral’s name, image, and image caption. Other details that are available about the mineral should be displayed below the image caption. See detail.html and detail-preview.png.

-Use a template filter to display the name of each attribute in title case.

-Write unit tests to test that each view is displaying the correct information.

-Make the templates match the style used in the example files.
Look at the example HTML files and global.css to determine which id and class attributes to use on the elements in the pages you generate.
